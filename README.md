At the moment Nicla is mounted on a stick to be close as possible to the ground and displays results on a small screen. 
Depending on a real case test results which i plan to perform on upcoming mushroom season in a forest i might turn it into wrist watch or attach to a jacket in some way.
# Testing indoors
First testing phase indoors with dried boletus.

# One more task while waiting
* Collecting data in the forest by controlling sampling from MushroomDetector device and ingest directly to edge impulse using mobile wifi hotspot.
